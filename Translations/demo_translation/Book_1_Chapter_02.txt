Following what has been said, it would be appropriate to discuss for how many and what purposes this treatise is useful. It is useful for three things: for training, for conversations, and for the sciences according to philosophy. That it is useful for training is evident from the matters themselves; for having a method, we will be able to more easily undertake arguments about any subject proposed. For conversations, because having enumerated the opinions of the many, we will converse with them not from foreign doctrines but from their own views, redirecting whatever they do not seem to us to be saying well. For the sciences according to philosophy, because being able to raise difficulties on both sides of a question, we will more easily discern in each case both the true and the false. Furthermore, it is useful for the primary principles of each science. For it is impossible to say anything about these principles from the principles specific to the proposed science, since the principles are prior to everything, but it is necessary to discuss them through the generally accepted opinions about each subject. This is unique to or most characteristic of dialectic; for being investigative in nature, it has a path to the principles of all methods.

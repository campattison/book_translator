TOPICS I.

The purpose of this treatise is to find a method by which we shall be able to reason about any proposed problem from reputable opinions, and when sustaining an argument ourselves, will avoid saying anything contrary. First, then, we must state what a syllogism is and what its different kinds are, in order to grasp dialectical syllogism; for this is what we are seeking in the present treatise.

A syllogism is an argument in which, certain things being posited, something different from what is established necessarily follows through what is established. Demonstration occurs when the syllogism proceeds from true and primary premises, or from premises derived from the knowledge of these through primary and true premises. Dialectical syllogism is that which reasons from reputable opinions. True and primary things are those that have credibility not through other things but through themselves; for in the case of scientific principles, one should not ask for the reason why, but each principle should be credible in itself. Reputable opinions are those that are accepted by everyone, or by the majority, or by the wise—either all of them, or most, or those who are the most recognized and reputable. Contentious syllogism is one that proceeds from opinions that appear to be reputable but are not, and also one that merely appears to proceed from reputable or apparently reputable opinions. For not everything that appears reputable is actually reputable. None of the so-called reputable opinions presents an entirely superficial appearance, as happens with the principles of contentious arguments; for immediately and in most cases, the nature of the falsehood in them is clear to those able to perceive even small distinctions. Let the first of the aforementioned contentious syllogisms be called a syllogism, but the second a contentious syllogism but not a syllogism, since it appears to reason syllogistically but does not actually do so.

Besides all the syllogisms mentioned, there are fallacies that arise from premises peculiar to certain sciences, as happens in geometry and related disciplines. This method seems to differ from the syllogisms mentioned; for the one who draws false diagrams reasons neither from true and primary premises nor from reputable ones. It does not fall under the definition, for it accepts neither what is accepted by all, nor by the majority, nor by the wise—neither what is accepted by all of them, nor by most, nor by the most reputable—but it constructs its syllogism from premises peculiar to the science yet not true. For by either drawing semicircles incorrectly or by drawing certain lines in ways they should not be drawn, one creates the fallacy.

Let what has been said constitute the kinds of syllogisms, as outlined in general terms. Speaking generally about all that has been said and what will be said hereafter, let this much be defined by us, because we do not propose to give a precise account of any of these matters, but wish to go through them only in outline, considering it entirely sufficient for the present method to be able to recognize each of them in some way.
